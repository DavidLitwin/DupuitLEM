## Run DupuitLEM models from generated parameters

Scripts here are used to run DupuitLEM models where parameters have been
generated by a script in the `generate_parameters` folder. These models evolve
landscapes with hydrology driven by the selected hydrological model. Make sure
the model used here corresponds to that intended by the generate_parameters
script. Scripts assume that SLURM is used on an HPC to generate
an array of model runs. Example of a SLURM call that would run these models is:

`sbatch --array=0-24 run_batch_rock.sh model_stoch_sp_nld_svm.py stoch_sp_gam_sigma_1`

Where `run_batch_rock.sh` is the shell script for copying the model run script,
and running that script. Calling the shell script when generating parameters
has already created folders `stoch_sp_gam_sigma_1-0` through
`stoch_sp_gam_sigma_1-10`. Within those folders, a folder called `data` is made
to store the saved model output.
